# playsound often fails to build on Windows/Python 3.11+/3.12+. We use a playback fallback in tts.py
# If you want a dedicated audio playback package, consider installing one of these manually:
# pip install simpleaudio    # lightweight, wav-only
# pip install pyglet         # mp3/wav playback (bigger)

# Backend server dependencies for local API used by React frontend

flask-cors

# Note: Some packages (PyAudio) are easiest to install on Windows via pipwin or prebuilt wheels.
# Ollama itself is a separate system (not a pip package) â€” see README_RUN.md for details.
